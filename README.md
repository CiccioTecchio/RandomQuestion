# RandomQuestion

I use this script to prepare for the exams. Given a file with questions like **domande_bd.txt**, the .txt file must have a question for each line.  
This script prints the questions in the file on the screen
## How to run
Compile **question.c** with
```bash
gcc question.c
```
Run **a.out**
```bash
./a.out <name of file whit question>
