# RandomQuestion

I use this script to prepare for the exams. Given a file with questions like **domande_bd.txt**, the number of lines in the file, and a seed for the ```
srand()```function. This script print a question on the screen.  
## How to run
Compile **question.c** with
```bash
gcc question.c
```
Run **a.out**
```bash
./a.out <name of file whit question> <number of line> <seed number>
